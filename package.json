  "description": "​ ## Objective: The objective of this assignment is to evaluate your skills in handling data on the backend using Node.JS and PostgreSQL. ​ ## Requirements: You are required to develop a RESTful API that allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete data on a PostgreSQL database. The API should be developed using Typescript and Node.JS, and should conform to the following specifications: 1. The API should support CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations for a single resource - User. - A User resource should have the following attributes: - id: unique identifier for the user (string or UUID) - name: user's name (string) - email: user's email address (string) - password: user's password (string) 1. The API should handle input validation and provide appropriate error messages for invalid inputs. 1. The API should be secured using JWT authentication. 1. The API should be well documented with clear instructions on how to run the code and test the API. ​ ## Additional Information: 1. You can use any Node.JS and PostgreSQL libraries that you deem necessary. 1. You can assume that the database schema and tables have already been created. 1. You can use any tool or framework that you are comfortable with for testing the API. 1. You are encouraged to write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code. ​ ## Deliverables: 1. A README file with clear instructions on how to run the code and test the API.",
